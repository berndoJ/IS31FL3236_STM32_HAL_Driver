IS31FL3236_STM32_HAL_Driver is an driver implementation for the CubeMX HAL environment
running on the STM32 family of microcontroller devices. The purpose of this software
is to provide a basic hardware abstraction level for the IS31FL3236 LED-Driver chip.

The library itself is written in C and can be used in C as well as C++ STM32 CubeMX
projects.


## Including the library

The library can be added to a project by copying `is31fl3236_driver.h` to the include directory and copying `is31fl3236_driver.c` to the source directory.

In order to use this library, `is31fl3236_driver.h` has to be included in the source code of the project.
This file contains all necessary declarations in order to use the library correctly.
