This project is a driver for the IS31FL3236 IC from ISSI for use with the STM32 and the HAL library from ST. The whole driver is designed to work with the HAL / Cube(MX) library of ST, but can be portet to other hardwares.
## Implementation
This driver can be implemented in to any STM32 project built upon the HAL library of ST. More information on the implementation can be found on the GitHub wiki of this repository.
